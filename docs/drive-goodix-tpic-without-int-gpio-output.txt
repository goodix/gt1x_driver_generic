	Drive Goodix TPIC without INT GPIO Output
========================================================

1.Background
------------

Goodix touch IC has a special mechanism that INT GPIO is used for I2C address
selection and GPIO synchronization during the hardware reset process.
The reason for designing this mechanism is to prevent i2c address conflict.
The main flow of this mechanism is as follows:

	reset pin output 0 -> INT pin output 1 if i2c address is 0x14, or output 0 if
	i2c address is 0x5D -> reset pin output 1 -> delay and wait until  hardware
	address selection circuit initialization completes. -> INT pin output 0 to inform the
	firmware that it can safely output INT pulse.

But in kernal3.13 or later versions, the GPIO subsystem has restricted the output
of GPIO which had been tied to IRQ line. Therefore, the mechanism described above
is unable to work now.

To solve this problem, we fix the I2C address in the firmware to 0x14, and 
discard the operation on INT GPIO in our touch driver.


2.How-to
---------

If your kernel has the restriction on the output of GPIO tied to IRQ line, 
   follow the steps below:

   - Disable CONFIG_GTP_INT_SEL_SYNC in menuconfig.

   - Modify devicetree node: pull up the INT GPIO in pinctrl dts.
   Note that the pull-up state of INT GPIO is necessary and important. If the
   firmware in flash is damaged, then the I2C address will be determined by
   the on-chip address selection circuit; this circuit will select an address based
   on the level of INT GPIO during the reset process.
   That’s why we pull up INT GPIO to ensure 0x14 address is always selected
   to communicate. See below for example:
   ```
   i2c@f9927000 { /*Goodix BLSP1 QUP5 */
	   goodix_ts@14 {
		   compatible = "goodix,gt1x";
		   reg = <0x14>;
		   goodix,reset-gpio = <&msmgpio 16 0x00>;
		   goodix,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 17 0x00>;
		   pinctrl-names = "default";
		   pinctrl-0 = <&ts_int_pull_up>;

	   };

	   //e.g. in msm8916-pinctrl.dtsi
	   pmx_ts_int {
		   qcom,pins = <&gp 13>;
		   qcom,pin-func = <0>;
		   qcom,num-grp-pins = <1>;
		   label = "pmx_ts_int";

		ts_int_pull_up: ts_int_defalut {
					drive-strength = <16>;
					bias-pull-up;
				};
	    };
	 ```

	- Edit chip configuration data:
	   Set IRQ line to be falling-edge triggered
	   Set INT to be woken up by low level.

	   Note:
	   Falling-edge is not mandatory for IRQ trigger type. but in consideration
	   of power saving, falling-edge is recommended.
	   Ask Goodix FAE to check the configuration data.

	- Use address fixed firmware
	   Not all the chip firmware  has fixed the I2C address and discard INT
	   synchronization.
	   Ask Goodix FAE to provide address fixed firmware.



3.Driver test
-------------

- If power consumption in chip sleep mode is larger than expected, check
INT wakeup-level in chip configuration data.
For example, if IRQ is set to be falling-edge  triggerred  while INT is
set to be woken up by  high level, the firmware will never enter sleep mode.
